Feeling dizzy? This is another normal pregnancy side effect, and it's due to the fact that your blood pressure has dropped. Your blood can't move as fast as it used to, so you may feel lightheaded when you stand up or after standing for a long period of time.

Stick to plucking, waxing and shaving for removalâ€”bleaches and depilatories contain unsafe chemicals.
