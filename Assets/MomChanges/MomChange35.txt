Another labor signal to watch for is extra-thick vaginal discharge that's pink or even a bit blood-tinged. This is the start of your mucus plug dropping. The mucus plug is a ball of tissue that's been blocking your cervical opening during pregnancy to keep your uterus safe from germs. Losing your plug doesn't mean that labor's starting ASAP, though. Many women lose their plugs up to two weeks before labor officially begins.
