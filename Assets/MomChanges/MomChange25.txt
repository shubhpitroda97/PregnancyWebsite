Get ready to kiss your petite little belly goodbye soon, if you haven't already. Your uterus is growing big-time! It is now about the size of a soccer ball. As your uterus continues to expand upward—the top is nearly midway between your breasts and belly button now—your middle will grow longer and wider. This all makes sense, since your baby's going to be pushing past the two-pound mark in no time at all, and you've gotta make room for him in there. You may also be experiencing carpal tunnel syndrome, which causes numb and tingly fingers. Luckily, like most pregnancy symptoms, it usually goes away shortly after your baby is born and your pregnancy swelling subsides.
