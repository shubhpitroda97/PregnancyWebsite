Not as graceful as you used to be? Don't worry if you're a bit more wobbly these days; your growing belly has shifted your center of gravity, which can make you more prone to slips and spills. You'll adjust eventually, subconsciously tweaking your posture and gait to offset that expanding tummy. But these changes (and your compensations for them) can throw your spinal alignment out of whack, triggering an achy back. To prevent the pain, stand up straight when you walk so your hips and shoulders stay lined up. Sitting with your feet slightly elevated and sleeping on your side in a fetal position (just like baby!) can help.
