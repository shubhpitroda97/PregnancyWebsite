Your baby doesn't have much elbow room these daysâ€”and, happily, that's probably going to mean fewer elbow jabs to the ribs for you. Because space in your uterus is running out, your baby becomes less active at this point in the pregnancy. You may also notice that her movements are affected by your daily routine: how much and when you eat, what position you are in, and sounds from the world outside can all affect your baby's activity level.
