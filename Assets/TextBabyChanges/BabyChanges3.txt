Amazingly, your child's sex and all of her inherited genetic characteristics—such as eye color, hair color, skin, and body type—have been set since the moment of conception. Your developing baby, now called a zygote, has 46 chromosomes—23 from you and 23 from your partner. These chromosomes help determine your baby's sex and traits such as eye and hair color, and, to some extent, personality and intelligence. After fertilization, the ball of cells, now an embryo, will wrap up its journey through the fallopian tube and burrow itself into the wall of your uterus for nourishment—a process known as implantation.
