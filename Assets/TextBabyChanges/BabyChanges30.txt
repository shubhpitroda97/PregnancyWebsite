From this point on, your baby will gain about a half pound each week. All that baby weight is for more than filling out his chubby cheeks. Now that all of his major body systems are in place and functioning, he needs padding to protect and insulate his organs. His built-up fat tissue will also help him regulate his body temperature after birthand provide the energy he needs. Because your baby is adding fat and growing bigger, you might find his movements become less frequentâ€”it's getting harder for him to maneuver. But if you're not feeling any jabs or the occasional kick, tell your health care provider.
