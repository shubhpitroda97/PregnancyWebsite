Lanugo, your baby's first ultrafine, downy hair, now covers his back, shoulders, ears, and forehead. It helps him retain body heat, but once he gains enough fat to do the job, this hair will fall off—probably before birth. Facial expressions are your baby's newest trick—he can frown, squint, grimace and wince. Don't worry—he's just flexing his facial muscles, not indicating his mood.
