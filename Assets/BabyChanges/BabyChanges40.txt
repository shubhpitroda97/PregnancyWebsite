When your baby arrives, she will be evaluated and graded (zero to two points each) on the following factors: activity and muscle tone, pulse (heart rate), grimace response (medically known as ""reflex irritability""), appearance (skin coloration) and respiration (breathing rate and effort). This sum will determine the baby's Apgar score, an initial measure of her health. Most healthy babies have an Apgar between seven and nine (few babies get a 10).
