Your baby's preparing for her arrival in just a few short weeks! This week, the protective vernix caseosa (that cheese-like, white, waxy coating that's keeping her skin safe) begins to thicken, ensuring that her birthday suit stays smooth and well-moisturized during D-day. Your baby will likely arrive covered in the stuff, especially in the folds under her arms, behind her ears, and in the crotch area. But it'll all be washed off very shortly after birthâ€”during her first-ever bath.
