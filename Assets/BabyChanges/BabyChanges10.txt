Up until now your baby was classified as an embryo, but by the end of this week he will be a fetus and lots of changes are on the way. Paddle-like, or webbed, hands and feet will now separate into fingers and toes, bones will begin to harden and his kidneys are now producing urine. Most impressive? At this point your baby's brain is developing at astounding rates—nearly 250,000 neurons are forming every minute! The end of the embryonic stage also marks a turning point for development dangers—your baby is much less susceptible to them now.
